# Making code readable

This exercise was about making messy code readable and up to standards.

## Why?

To make code readable and efficient for yourself in the future and your co-workers. It's a hassle when you have to go through the code everytime to try to make sense of what's happening so yeah if you want to be loved by you coworkers start formatting your code.

## When?

Always refractor your code, it's a good habit to have in general and after a while you will do it automatically and will thank your past self for learning how to refractor.

## How?

Start by tackling 1 problem at a time for example you can start with variable names. (Make the variables explain what they are well and use the same stule ex. camelCase or under_score) after that you go down the list identation, whitespace ... untill you are satisfied. Make it feel consistent.
